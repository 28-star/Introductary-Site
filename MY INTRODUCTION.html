<br>I'm Krishna Bansal, a b.tech student persuing my computer science degree from IIT Roorkee. I am a resident of gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. It's really great to be finally here. The hard work it costed to reach here was really something that need a huge amount of potential, patience and self confidence .Basically all these three were fueled by God,my parents and teachers in my life...and it is something which I can never forget for my whole life.<br>

Introducing more about my personality. I am a jolly and flexible person who just want fun and adventure at every step of life.I am not a perfectionist but yes somewhat concious for my career and things related to it. I accept the fact that seriousness is a diminished part of my persona ..I believe in making more and more companions..even love making fun of them (counted among my favourite works).</font></div>
